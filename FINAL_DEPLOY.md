## 📱 DEPLOY IN 3 CLICKS

### **STEP 1: Deploy Frontend**

**I've opened Vercel for you!** It should auto-configure:

```
✓ Repository: Niyas-J/Medi-host
✓ Framework: Vite
✓ Root Directory: frontend
✓ Build Command: npm run build
✓ Output Directory: dist
```

**Just click "Deploy"!**

---

### **STEP 2: Wait 2-3 Minutes**

Vercel will:
- ✓ Install dependencies
- ✓ Build your React app
- ✓ Deploy to their CDN
- ✓ Give you a live URL!

---

### **STEP 3: Get Your Live URL**

You'll get something like:
```
https://medi-host-xxx.vercel.app
```

**Share it with anyone!** 🎉

---

## 🎯 WHAT YOUR LIVE APP WILL HAVE:

✅ **Satellite Map** with realistic buildings  
✅ **1-20 km Search Radius** (adjustable slider)  
✅ **Visual Search Circle** on map  
✅ **Real Hospitals** from OpenStreetMap  
✅ **Interactive Markers** with details  
✅ **Appointment Booking**  
✅ **Emergency SOS Button**  
✅ **Admin Dashboard** at `/admin`  
✅ **Map Toggle** (Satellite/Street view)  
✅ **Mobile Responsive**  
✅ **Filter by Type** (Hospital/Clinic/Pharmacy)  
✅ **Location Search** (any city worldwide)  

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:

**Frontend Only Deployment** (for now):

The frontend will work perfectly, but the backend features (appointment booking, emergency alerts) won't work until you deploy the backend.

**To add backend later:**
1. Deploy backend to Railway: https://railway.app
2. Add `VITE_API_URL` environment variable in Vercel
3. Redeploy

**OR** just enjoy the frontend features:
- ✅ Map works perfectly
- ✅ Hospital search works
- ✅ All UI features work
- ❌ Booking/alerts need backend

---

## 🎊 AFTER DEPLOYMENT:

1. **Visit your live URL**
2. **Share with friends!**
3. **Test on your phone!**
4. **Deploy backend to Railway** (optional, takes 5 minutes)
