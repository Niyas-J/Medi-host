# 🚀 Simple Vercel Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ Important: Deploy Frontend Only on Vercel

For the **easiest deployment**, I recommend:
- ✅ **Frontend on Vercel** (React app)
- ✅ **Backend on Railway** (Flask API)

Why? Flask apps work better on Railway, and it's just as easy!

---

## 🎯 **Option 1: Frontend on Vercel + Backend on Railway (RECOMMENDED)**

### **Step 1: Deploy Frontend to Vercel**

1. **Visit:** https://vercel.com/new

2. **Sign in** with GitHub

3. **Import Repository:**
   - Search for: `Niyas-J/Medi-host`
   - Click **"Import"**

4. **Configure:**
   ```
   Framework Preset:  Vite
   Root Directory:    frontend
   Build Command:     npm run build
   Output Directory:  dist
   ```

5. Click **"Deploy"** and wait ~2 minutes

6. **Save your frontend URL:** 
   ```
   https://medi-host-xxx.vercel.app
   ```

### **Step 2: Deploy Backend to Railway**

1. **Visit:** https://railway.app/new

2. **Sign in** with GitHub

3. **Deploy from GitHub Repo:**
   - Select: `Niyas-J/Medi-host`
   - Click **"Deploy Now"**

4. **Configure:**
   - Root Directory: `backend`
   - Start Command: `python app.py`

5. **Add Environment Variables:**
   ```
   FLASK_ENV=production
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-vercel-frontend-url.vercel.app
   ```

6. **Generate Domain:**
   - Settings → Networking → Generate Domain
   
7. **Save your backend URL:**
   ```
   https://medi-host-production.up.railway.app
   ```

### **Step 3: Connect Frontend to Backend**

1. Go to your **Vercel project**
2. **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL = https://your-railway-backend-url.up.railway.app
   ```
4. **Redeploy** the frontend

## 🎯 **Option 2: Both on Vercel (If You Prefer)**

### **Troubleshooting Your 404 Error:**

The error `404: DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` means:
- The deployment failed or was cancelled
- You're trying to access the wrong URL
- The deployment is still in progress

### **Fresh Deploy Steps:**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:** https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. **Delete failed deployments** (if any)

3. **Start Fresh:**
   - Click **"Add New..."** → **"Project"**
   - Import: `Niyas-J/Medi-host`
   
4. **Deploy Frontend First:**
   ```
   Framework: Vite
   Root Directory: frontend
   Build Command: npm run build
   Output Directory: dist
   ```

5. **Check Build Logs:**
   - If it fails, click on the deployment
   - View the build logs to see what went wrong

---

## 🔍 **Check Your Vercel Dashboard**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Look for your projects
3. Click on the latest deployment
4. Check the status:
   - ✅ **Ready** = Deployment successful
   - ⏳ **Building** = Still in progress
   - ❌ **Error** = Failed (check logs)

---

## 📋 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: 404 Deployment Not Found**
**Solutions:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
2. Check if deployment is still building
3. Try redeploying from Vercel dashboard
4. Use the correct project URL from Vercel

### **Issue: Build Failed**
**Solutions:**
1. Make sure Root Directory is set to `frontend`
2. Verify Framework Preset is `Vite`
3. Check build logs for specific errors

### **Issue: Backend Doesn't Work on Vercel**
**Solution:**
Use Railway for backend instead (it's designed for Flask apps!)

## 🚀 **Quick Deploy Links**

### Deploy Frontend to Vercel:
👉 https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/Niyas-J/Medi-host&root-directory=frontend

### Deploy Backend to Railway:
👉 https://railway.app/new

---

## ✅ **After Successful Deployment**

Test these URLs:

1. **Frontend:**
   - Open: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
   - Should show the map and UI

2. **Backend API:**
   - Open: `https://your-backend.up.railway.app/api/health`
   - Should show: `{"status": "healthy"}`

3. **Full App:**
   - Frontend should load hospitals from backend
   - Map should show satellite view
   - Location detection should work

---

## 🆘 **Still Having Issues?**

### Check These:

1. **Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Are there any failed deployments?
   - What do the build logs say?

2. **Environment Variables:**
   - Is `VITE_API_URL` set correctly?
   - Does it point to your Railway backend?

3. **Backend Logs (Railway):**
   - Is the Flask app running?
   - Any errors in the logs?

---

## 💡 **Pro Tip:**

If you're getting too many errors with Vercel for the backend:

**Just deploy frontend on Vercel, backend on Railway!**

Railway is specifically designed for backends like Flask, and deployment is literally:
1. Connect GitHub
2. Select repo
3. Done! ✅

**Try Railway for the backend - it's much easier! 🚂**
